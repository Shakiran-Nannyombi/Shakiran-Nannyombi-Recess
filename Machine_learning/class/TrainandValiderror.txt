Training and Validation Loss

These are metrics used to monitor the model's performance and generalization ability.

- The Loss represents the discrepancy between the predicted output and the actual target value.

Training Loss
- Training Loss or error refers to the error on the data that the model was trained on.
- Directly affects weight adjustments in the model.
- Provides insights into how well the model fits the training data.

Common Training Loss Functions
- Mean Squared Error
- Cross-Entropy Loss

Validation Loss
- Validation Loss is the error on unseen data, used to evaluate the model's performance outside the training data set.
- Helps in assessing the model's generalization.
- Used as a criterion for early stopping to prevent overtraining.

Relevance of Tracking Both Losses
- Tracking both training and validation loss helps to monitor overfitting and underfitting.
- Provides a better understanding of the model's learning progress.

Epoch
- An epoch is one complete pass through the entire training dataset.

Frameworks: Django, Flask, and TensorFlow
- Django and Flask are web frameworks.
- TensorFlow is a machine learning framework.
