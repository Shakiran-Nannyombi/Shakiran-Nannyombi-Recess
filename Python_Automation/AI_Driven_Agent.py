# Post Automation Agent
# Example: Create an AI-driven agent that automates tasks of creating posts on X.com (formerly Twitter) using Python.
# for a period of 30 days, with a focus on automating the process of posting content, engaging with followers, and
# analyzing post performance.

# How it will work:
# 1. **Content Creation**: The agent will generate content ideas based on trending topics and user interests.
# 2. **Post Scheduling**: It will schedule posts at optimal times for maximum engagement.
# 3. **Engagement**: The agent will respond to comments and messages, fostering community interaction.
# 4. **Performance Analysis**: It will analyze post performance and adjust strategies accordingly.
# 5. **Learning and Adaptation**: The agent will learn from user interactions and adapt its strategies over time.

# Import necessary libraries

# X.com API credentials
API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret'
ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your_access_token_secret'

# Authenticate to the X.com API
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(API_KEY, API_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Predefine the text generation model
textgen = textgenrnn.TextgenRnn()

# Predefine list of daily posts
daily_posts = [
    "Monday Motivation: Start your week with a positive mindset!",
    "Tuesday Tips: Remember to take breaks and stay hydrated!",
    "Wednesday Wisdom: Midweek is a great time to reflect on your goals.",
    "Thursday Thoughts: What are you grateful for today?",
    "Friday Fun: Share your favorite weekend plans!",
    "Saturday Spotlight: Highlight a community member or project.",
    "Sunday Summary: Reflect on the week and set intentions for the next one."
